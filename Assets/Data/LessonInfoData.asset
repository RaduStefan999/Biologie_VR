    Information: he most characteristic organ of ferns is the compound leaf, the
      stem is generally horizontal and underground and is called the rhizome. The
      root system consists of several adventitious roots, as they are attached laterally
      to the stem.

    Information: Earth muscles - Bryophytes in the strict sense - Gametophyte with
      leaves The visible part with chlorophyll is a gametophyte (haploid, with n
      chromosomes). The male gametophyte produces the gametes, the male which gives
      the antheridia (the male reproductive organ) which produces the anterozoites
      (the male sex cells). The female gametophyte produces the female gametangs
      that give the archaeon (the female reproductive organ) that produces the oosphere
      (the female sex cell).

    Information: 'Plants are autotrophic chlorophyll eukaryotic organisms. Plants
      are subdivided into two large groups: talophytes and cormophytes through the
      progressive colonization of the terrestrial environment. Talophytes are plants
      that are initially aquatic or live in humid environments. They have a vegetative
      apparatus (part of a plant that ensures the realization of its vital metabolic
      functions), always slightly differentiated called the talus.'
